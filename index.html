<p>My name is Troy Glossop, I am 45 and I currently live in Perth, Western Australia.<br>I was born in Perth, and grew up in the Wheatbelt on a farm, about 250km east of Perth. When I was a teenager, I moved to Perth to do vocals in Metal, Hardcore and Grindcore bands. Writing and performing music was a large part of my life until 2013 when I decided to stop performing live for health reasons.<br>
My hobbies include building and flying FPV Quadcopters, playing Street Fighter semi-competitively and hanging out with my best mate, my 19 year old cat “Little Cat”.<br>
I am currently a Fulltime student, pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.<br>
<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
I enjoy many facets of IT. I am an avid PC gamer, but not as dedicated as I once was. I build and configure Radio Control FPV Quadcopters which involves Open Source firmware and PID Automation control, and I am in the process of building a PC Racing sim cockpit using old android handsets as a HUD and switchbox.
<h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
When I was 5 or so years old, I saw the movie “War Games” in the cinema. It really planted a seed, I was obsessed with computers and started saving whatever pocket money I could earn. I eventually bought a second hand Vic20 when I was about 8 or so. Funnily enough the power brick exploded after a few months and I could not find a replacement. This really made me determined to be adept with Electronics in addition to Computer hardware.
<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3> 
As a teenager I had access to a reasonably new 386, and a modem. Calling BBS’s is most probably one of the happiest times of my life. I really wanted to run a BBS, so I could play the door games without calling Sydney or Perth on the modem and accruing large long distance Phone bills. I believe learning to configure and run a BBS with little documentation or knowledge was the start of my passion for Computers, along with the previously mentioned movie “War Games”.
<h3>Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
I am familiar with many areas of IT. I am mostly self educated which has enabled me to pick up many skills, which I then used at my places of Employment. These include, but are not limited to: 
Linux and Unix System Administration, Server Administration, Virtualisation in a Data Centre environment, Administration of PCIE payment platforms, Hardware troubleshooting and repair, Windows Server Administration, Network Administration, Support Level 1, 2 and 3 and Documentation of Procedures. 
Additionally, I worked as the assigned System Administrator for a Team of Developers, Administrating the Live, Stage and Development environments. Our main focus was Development of Payment applications, which was used to process payments for one of Australias largest Telco's. I also have assisted in initial rollout, configuration, ongoing administration and maintenance of a PCIE compliant datacentre.
<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
I wanted to learn Programming, and RMIT is very highly regarded in Australia. When the chance to study via OUA presented itself, I decided I would apply to the University I would want to attend in person. Even though I am currently only in my first semester, the faculty and students I have interacted with have led me to believe I have made a great choice.
<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
To learn how to program Java and Programming in General in a consistent and methodical way. I wish to acquire good habits and have a well-rounded knowledge, which has been the major hurdle I could not overcome alone when self-learning programming over the years.<br>

<a href="firmware-hardware-eng.png" title="Link to Screenshot of Job listing">Link to Seek job listing Screenshot</a></br>

<h3>Basic Description</h3>
This job has very broad role description, from designing, testing, prototyping and field testing automation related hardware to software engineering and database familiarity. The role is for someone with advanced electronic skills, and the supporting software skills to write firmware for the hardware in question. This job entails many different aspects, which is why it appeals to me. I repair and assemble many electronic devices in my spare time for fun, and really enjoy soldering and working with electronics. 



<h3> Skills/Experience required</h3>
<ul>
<li>An Engineering based Degree, such as Mechanical, Mechatronics, Electrical or Electronic Engineering.</li>
<li>Practical experience with Electronic components, such assembling, soldering, repairing and troubleshooting components.</li>
<li>Ability to multitask and meet strict deadlines on multiple simultaneous tasks.</li>
<li>Working knowledge of multiple software suites and languages. AutoCAD and Visio are design tools, Access DB is a Database/Information Management System often used for reporting and analysis. Python and VB (MS Visual Basic) are both high level programming languages. SQL is a query language, often used in SQL Databases. </li>
<li>An active interest in Engineering, Automation, Hardware and Development of Firmware.</li>
<li>Great Communication skills, organizational skills and professional presentation.</li>
<li>A valid Australian drivers license.</li>

<h3> My Skillset against the Skills required for the role </h3>
<li>I do not hold an Engineering degree, however, it is my wish to continue my studies further and gain a Degree in Mechatronics Engineering.</li>
<li>I have over 25 years experience soldering, and working with electronics.</li>
<li>My ability to multitask is better than average I believe, and have often had to work to deadlines to meet contract requirements.</li>
<li> Due to health reasons, I will never be able to hold a valid Drivers License.</li>
<li>I have used AutoCAD and Visio before, however not for designing components. I had to design a detailed floor plan in Visio of my workplace to assist in the documentation I was writing for the Disaster Recovery Plan.</li>
<li>I have used a very old version of AutoCAD at Tafe in 1995, where I completed a short course on CAD. </li>
<li>I have not used Access for many years, and then I had only used the consumer Access version that is bundled with MS Office. </li>
<li>Python and Visual Basic are both programming languages. In the past I have completed a few tutorials on Python to help my friends nephew with his studies, and about 20 years ago I did a small Visual Basic calculator as a programming exercise. </li>
<li>I have lots of experience Administrating SQL Databases, MySQL, MsSQL and ASE servers and often would have to design and perform complex queries to resolve issues on a live platform, in addition to being responsible for monitoring of the SQL service instance.</li></ul><br>
<h3>How I would obtain a role with the above requirements</h3>
Firstly, I would obtain a Mechatronics Degree, as this is an area I am extremely interested in. I have enquired about obtaining one previously, however I felt my Math skill is extremely lacking, so I would need to do some foundation learning in that area before attempting a degree. During my degree I would be exposed to using design software in an Electrical Engineering type environment, so that will assist me greatly in using AutoCAD and Visio. I am extremely confident with my soldering ability, however my theory is very lacking, as I am self taught. While I understand Ohm's Law and other basic fundamentals you should know before working with high discharge LiPO batteries (for example), I could not design a Speed controller from scratch. However, I can repair one and identify its components very easily. This gap in my learning will be resolved again, by completing a Degree in Engineering, either Electrical or Mechatronics engineering.<br>
I am very confident my foundational knowledge of IT and systems will allow me to pick up any It related skills I do not currently have.<br>

Your Scores:

Auditory: 45%
Visual: 30%
Tactile: 25%
You are an Auditory learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.

Auditory
If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. 
You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. 
You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.

As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. 
People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.

Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.

Sit where you can hear.
Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.
Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.
Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.
Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.
Have test questions read to you out loud.
Study new material by reading it out loud.
Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.</pre>

</pre>

<h4>What do the tests mean to you? </h4>
I have known my MBTI results are INTJ for quite a while, as a friend of mine asked me to take a MBTI test to help her with her University assignment. Personally I think it is rather interesting, but I do not put too much stock in these test results, the test was way too short to indicate more than a general outline of my personality type. Also the results are quite flattering and appeal to my vanity, so I believe putting too much faith in them might be a bit narcissistic of me. <br>
I think the Learning Style test is accurate in some regards, I always listen and turn off distractions. When I was younger however, this was not a problem and I would study with loud music on my headphones all the time. Perhaps this has changed as I age, my hearing is poor in one ear and I find that noises from that side really distract me a great deal, as they are very indistinct.<br>
When I was young, I did a similar test to this psychometric test and did very well, and was accepted into accelerated learning classes as a result. So it was a little disappointing I have not maintained a very high score, but again, this test was very short, and I am confident with more questions, I would of placed higher.<br>
<h4>How will these results influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
I am very experienced at working in a team, I do not think these test results will change how I approach team work at all. I already knew most of these results instinctively, or from taking a similar test previously. I perform best as a team member, not a leader, and am happy to take direction.
<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
I personally believe a layman trying to interpret other peoples results could be very counter productive. If I had the training and understanding, I would make sure complimentary personality types are in the same team and there are no conflicting types. I am not a leader by any means, and I am happy to take a supporting role. 


<h3>Project Idea<br>
Troy’s I/O Engine (TI/OE):</h3>
<h4>Overview:</h4>

A free and Open Source program for Windows 10 computers that allows the user to easily combine multiple input devices into one Virtual controller. This virtual device can be used on Simulators and Games that do not allow the user to mix inputs from multiple devices natively. TI/OE will be streamlined as not to confuse non-technical Users with options they do not need. It will also allow Users to share their configurations with each other and most importantly, be low latency and provide great performance<br>

<h4>Motivation:</h4>

I have movement difficulties, particularly on my right side, namely my right arm, elbow, hand, right leg, hip and foot. While I have close to full movement range, there is large amount of discomfort at times, which can make which can make using some Gaming devices quite a challenge. When trying to figure out a way I can continue to play games at a high level, I realised that instead of reinventing the wheel with custom made devices, I could just adapt the many, many devices I have to my needs.<br>
 For example, I have trouble pressing the Right triggers on a Gamepad for an extended period of time, however my left foot is perfectly fine, so why cannot I use the pedals from my Racing Sim Wheel setup to emulate the right triggers? Alternatively, I find using my right foot hard in Racing Sims, so why cannot I use a Game pad in my left hand to simulate the Right Pedal?<br><br> The only options right now are expensive hardware options, or closed ecosystem paid software. I want to enable all gamers to have fun, on their own terms, for free.
<h4>Description:</h4>
TI/OE is a Windows 10 application that will allow the user to combine multiple Input devices together into one virtual device. This virtual device will allow many unique configurations of devices to be used in applications which do not support them. At present, it is planned to support HID, DirectInput and XInput physical devices, and HID, DirectInput and XInput as virtual devices.<br>
The user will be able to select a Virtual Controller template from a list of commonly used options, such as Fight sticks, Game pads, Steering wheels, Pedals and Gear sticks, Flight sticks (also known as Yokes) and custom hybrid configurations.<br>
There will be options for users share their templates and configurations, via the built in TI/OE Configuration Tool, this will allow users to share, browse and download configurations using the TI/OE website as a repository. There will also be a console which will display relevant low level information, such as a verbose mode to assist in troubleshooting any issues that may arise. In addition, there will be a real time latency display for each device. This is so you can determine the latency of your USB devices, which is extremely desirable information for many gamers, and very hard information to find. This can also help a user troubleshoot the health of their USB devices.<br>
An additional feature is the ability to bind a keypress or device input to a keystroke. If you wish to use a gaming device with a program that does not accept input from DirectInput or XInput, this will circumvent this issue. What if you want to use a foot pedal to copy the highlighted text in your word processor? And another pedal to paste? You will be able to bind one to CTRL+C and the other to CTRL+V. I acknowledge the ability to bind key pressed to gamepads is feature is available in other programs, however, I feel that if you need this functionality, it should be included in the one “do it all” application as opposed to forcing the user to run another application in conjunction with TI/OE.<br>
When running TI/OE will minimize to the taskbar and have a very low overhead. The system requirements will be very low, as to enable anyone with a Windows 10 computer to use this application.<br>
Finally another feature I think will be extremely desirable, is the ability for TI/OE to report the battery level of your Bluetooth USB devices. Currently, when a Bluetooth Xbox or PS4 Gamepad is connected to a PC, you need to find a 3rd party application to report the battery level. I believe this feature along with the USB Latency meter will make TI/OE a very useful application, even if you have no desire to use the other features of TI/OE.
<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
The requirements to use TI/OE are a Windows 10 PC and some USB devices you with to use with TI/OE. However due to limitations of your PC, you may wish to use a USB hub if you intend to use more USB devices than the number of available USB ports. An Internet connection is required to visit the TI/OE website and download user shared configurations and content.<br>
<h4>Skills Required</h4>
The skills required to complete this project are as follows. A working knowledge of Windows 10 and the XInput API. In addition, knowledge of the Legacy API DirectInput for older and not-Windows devices, such as the Sony DS3 Gamepad and many older Fight sticks. As I am currently learning Java, I would endeavour to complete the project in this language.<br>
To enable users to be able to share their configurations on a central server, a low spec virtual Web server should be ideal, HTML, XML, and SQL would be a great starting point as the configurations will be in XML and have very low bandwidth requirements. Many existing Content Management Systems software packages could be utiltized for this purpose.

<h4>Outcome</h4>
If this project is successful, it will enable more users to empower themselves to play games their own way, without paying large sums of money, or being stuck in a closed source ecosystem. I hope to one day implement TI/OE as a stand alone Raspberry Pi distribution, that can turn a Raspberry Pi into a I/O engine that will work on any console, any PC, configurable via a web interface on the Raspberry Pi. If someone finds this application and it enabled them to find happiness in video games,  then I believe it will have been successful.<br>
